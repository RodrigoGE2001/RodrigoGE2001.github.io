### Design of a Biometric System for Voice Signals Processing
The goal of this project was to identify different voices using mathematical and statistical functions. This code was done using MATLAB, and allowed users to record their voices and analyze them. The most important function was the Fourier Fourier Transform, to find the most present frequencies. Then, we used statistical analysis to find the differences between the voice recordings, and display graphs and tables.
